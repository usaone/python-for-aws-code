# About the Code Download

There are essentially two sets of code: 

## 1 - Completed Python Code for HOLs

This code is located in the subdirectories of the "All Completed Code for HOLs" folder. Inside this folder, you'll find the fully-baked code for every hands-on challenge. We totally recommend riding shotgun with Eric and typing out the code alongside himâ€”it's the best way to let the knowledge really sink in! ðŸš€

But hey, if you hit a coding pothole or just wanna skip ahead to see how the magic's done, these code snippets are your backstage pass. Code on! ðŸŽ¸ðŸ¤“

## 2 - Other Code and Files

Even if you're riding the wave with Eric and hand-typing each line of code (kudos for that dedication!), there's a suite of essential files waiting in the wings for you. They're not optional side quests but part of the main storyline. So, make sure you've got those on hand as you progress.

These files and code are located in the subdirectories of the "Other Code and Files" folder.
